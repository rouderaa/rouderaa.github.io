<h2>These are the trials and tribulations of making my little
robot cart RoboPi.</h2>

<p>I want to take part in the PiWars challenges and challenges
indeed they are.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Choices, choices, choices</h2>

<p>Well what is this cart going to look like? It depends on what
it should be able to do. So reading the website of PiWars was the place
to start. After reading and pondering it looks like that speed is
important and image recognition. We want to see different kinds of
colored objects like barrels, zombies, and colored locations. So a
camera is needed. Since we also want to turn corners and follow lines,
we need to be able to steer the robot. Also, it would be nice if we can
detect walls. We also need to be able to navigate a route without the
help of a line. Finding out the distance to a wall would also be very
handy to prevent the robot from bumping into it. Maybe even our little
robot should be able to grab a barrel and even fire a little cannon. So
the option to add some components for a specific challenge is the way
to go. With all this, we have the hardware, mechanics, electronics, and
software to consider.</p>

<p>It would be nice if we can use a lot of open source and
available stuff.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>The base</h2>

<p>Our little robot has to carry batteries, a camera, some
computer, and other stuff. So it should not be too little but also not
too large, just right. The base that seems to fit the bill is this
thing.</p>

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/base.PNG" alt="Base Image" />
</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Dust is the enemy</h2>

<p>The encoders of the motors have no protection and are very
close to the
ground. In order to protect them against the dust and dirt of the
disaster world, we need to protect them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/nodustcovermotor.JPG" alt="No dust cover motor" />
</p>

<p>This is much better</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Attaching the main parts</h2>

<p>First things to do is to attach parts to the base of the robot
like the battery holder, some pcb to experiment on, add an arduino uno
with motor speed controll and so on.</p>

<img src="images/IMG_0138.jpg" alt="Base Image" id="rotateImage" style="width: 429px; height: 535px;" />
</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Lets add the rpi4 and camera with a frame</h2>

<p>The raspberry pi 4 will go to the front of the robot. I made a
3d design for it and also a place for the camera</p>

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/IMG_0149.jpg" alt="Base Image" />
<p>The time of flight sensors are at the front and two on the
side. In the past I found that these sensors can be troubled by ir
light so I added a sun protection cone to each one of them.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Yikes, spikes!</h2>

<p>The RoboPi robot has an orientation sensor onboard, the chip
BNO055. A great chip but now something weird was happening. When
rotating the robot at random times, huge spikes appeared in the z-angle
that we are interested in. After much pondering and trying another
driver, still no luck. So time for plan B. By using a median filter, we
can filter out these random spikes, and now the trace of the
orientation shows a smooth curve for the z-angle. Happy days, on to the
next challenge.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Wireless access to my robopi robot</h2>

<p>A very nice luxury is the abality to access the desktop of the
raspberry pi 4 of the robot from my laptop using wifi.
After some fidling and reading internet pages about this, the robopi
robot now is a wifi access point that I can use from my laptop. Happy
days.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>We need a cannon !</h2>

<p>To beat those pescy zombies we need a cannon ! Luckely there
was a great design on thingiverse.com of Markus Purtz that I could
adjust. Now the canon is starting to look like one.
</p>

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/canon1.jpg" alt="Canon building 1" />
<p>Two brushless motors will drive the nerf dart to the zombie. A
servo pushes the dart from a cartridge to the barrel and there is
another to tilt the canon so we can aim for zombies higher up.
</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>That cannon needs a base (first try)</h2>

<p>The big canon needs a sturdy base on the robot to stand on.
The first attempt from my 3d printed design turned out not quite
right...
</p>

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/IMG_0179.jpg" alt="Canon base attempt" />
<p>So back to the drawing board with a more modular design of the
base that can be printed in several parts and then assembled using
bolts.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>That cannon needs a better base (second try)</h2>

<p>Measurements of the holes for the base were wrong (duh).
Measured again, twice, now should be good.
</p>

<img style="height: 429px; width: 535px;" src="images/IMG_0181.jpg" alt="Canon base attempt 2" />
<p>Now in red and even seems to fit on the chassis, life is good.
Changed the way the poles are attached to the main frame with a bolt
and screw attach.</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>Smoke signals are not ok</h2>

<p>If your hardware gives out smoke signals, that is not good
:-).
Looks like the motor driver is gone because of a software error with
PWM I was not anticipating.
A well, luckly there are two motor drivers on the bord, need to fire up
my soldering iron to fix this. Turns out that did not work because also
the second motor driver got toasted somehow.
I found a electronic speed controller I can use and added that to the
robot. Disadvante is that now I can only control
the speed of the two motors by one controller. So no differential speed
is possible but the steering front should be enough I expect.
</p>

</div>

<div class="blog-entry">
<h2>A laser pointer on the barrel</h2>

<p>To find out where the cannon is pointing to I added a small
laser pointer diode.
It is controlled by the Arduino uno and so controllable by software.
Made a small bracket that clamps to the barrel.
Probably needs some super glue but it is ok for now.
